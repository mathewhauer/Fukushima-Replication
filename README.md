> Research on the destinations of environmentally induced migrants has found simultaneous migration to both nearby and long-distance destinations, most likely caused by the co-mingling of evacuee and permanent migrant data. Using a unique dataset of separate evacuee and migration destinations, we compare and contrast the pre-- (2010), peri-- (2011), and post-- (2012-2013) migration systems of permanent migrants and temporary evacuees of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. We construct and compare prefecture-to-prefecture migration matrices for Japanese prefectures to investigate the similarity of migration systems. We find evidence supporting the presence of two separate migration systems -- one for evacuees and one for more permanent migrants -- where evacuees seem to emphasize short distance migration while more permanent migrants emphasize migration to destinations with pre-existing ties. Additionally, our results show that permanent migration in the peri-- and post-periods is largely identical to the pre-existing migration system. Our results demonstrate stability in migration systems concerning migration after a major environmental event.
